Project Overview 📧📈

This project aims to enhance email marketing strategies for small to medium-sized businesses by using a machine learning model to analyze email interactions. The goal is to categorize emails and track engagement (ignored, read, acknowledged) to provide actionable insights for improving customer conversion and retention rates.

Files Included 📂

- email_campaign_ml_model.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning model code.
- data_email_campaign.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

Getting Started 🚀

Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- Necessary Python libraries (see below) 📚

Installation 🛠️
